/**
 * This is the interface for DBHelper. This class is used to access a database with the intent of storing and retrieving timelines.
 * Currently, this only adds and deletes the entire timeline, meaning that to change anything about the timeline means reading the 
 * entire thing to the database. Future development and refactoring of this could involve using each timeline's unique auto incremented
 * _id (used for using the database on android) to identify it so that methods could do specific changes to a timeline without having to
 * remove and read the entire thing. (This would speed up database operations)

 * Package: backend
 *
 * Note: could be updated to have _id as parameters, it will make editing and adding stuff a lot easier (add _id to Timeline and TLEvent).
